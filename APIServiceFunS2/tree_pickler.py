import pickle # a standard library

# pickling is used for object serialization and
# deserialization
# pickle: write a binary representation of an object
# to a file (for use later...)
# un/depickle: read a binary representation of an object
# from a file (to a python object in this memory)

# imagine you've just trained a MyDecisionTreeClassifier
# imagine you've just trained a MyRandomForestClassifier
# so you pickle the classifier object
# and unpickle later in your web app code

# let's do this with the interview tree from DecisionTreeFun
